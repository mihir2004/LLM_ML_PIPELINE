# 🚀 LLM-Integrated ML Pipeline

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline enhanced with **Large Language Model (LLM)** integration for automated experiment tracking, orchestration, and intelligent evaluation.  
This project demonstrates how to combine **classical ML workflows** with **modern LLM capabilities** to accelerate model development and deployment.

## ✨ Features

- 🔹 **End-to-End ML Workflow**: Covers data preprocessing, training, validation, and deployment.
- 🔹 **Experiment Tracking**: Integrated **MLflow** for logging hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts.
- 🔹 **LLM Integration**: Used **LangChain + Hugging Face APIs** for automated report generation and contextual analysis.
- 🔹 **API Orchestration**: Exposed services via **FastAPI** for model inference and LLM-enhanced responses.
- 🔹 **Containerized Deployment**: Dockerized services for portability and scalability.
- 🔹 **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL used to persist experiment metadata and model registry.
- 🔹 **Cloud Ready**: Deployed on **AWS EC2** with support for scaling pipelines.
